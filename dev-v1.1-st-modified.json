In order to secure additional funding, Westinghouse had to reassess the licensing fees for Tesla's AC patent, which was causing strain on the company's finances. By that time, Westinghouse had already paid an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck. In 1897, facing financial troubles, Westinghouse informed Tesla that unless things changed, he might lose control of the company, and Tesla might have to negotiate with the bankers for future royalty payments. To alleviate the financial burden, Westinghouse proposed buying Tesla's AC patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000, which was a relief from the previous agreement of $2.50 per AC horsepower due to the rapid popularity of alternating current technology.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 259, "text": "1896"}, {"answer_start": 259, "text": "1896"}, {"answer_start": 259, "text": "1896"}], "question": "When was a patent-sharing agreement signed between Westinghouse Electric and General Electric?", "id": "56e089ab231d4119001ac285"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 105, "text": "J.

I kept elements like the elevation of the host and chalice but made things like Mass vestments and candles optional, giving freedom in the way ceremonies were conducted.

My goal was to make the Mass more accessible, so I included hymns and parts of the liturgy in German for everyone to participate in, including my unison setting of the Creed.

This has required the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts to establish principles for resolving conflicts of laws across different systems. According to EU law, if there is a conflict between EU law and national law, EU law takes precedence. In a key case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer named Mr Costa protested against the nationalisation of Italian energy companies by refusing to pay his electricity bill to Enel. He argued that the Italian nationalisation law clashed with the Treaty of Rome and requested referrals to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court ruled that Costa's claim was invalid because the nationalisation law was from 1962, whereas the treaty had been in force since 1958. On the other hand, the Court of Justice determined that the Treaty of Rome did not prohibit energy nationalisation and that only the Commission, not Mr Costa, could bring a claim under the Treaty provisions. However, Mr Costa was allowed to argue that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would need to consider his claim for a referral if there was no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice emphasized, echoing its stance in Van Gend en Loos, that member states had limited their sovereign rights to create a body of law applicable to both their nationals and themselves based on reciprocity. EU law could not be overridden by domestic legal provisions without questioning the legal basis of the EU itself. This meant that any unilateral act by a member state would not be valid. In a similar vein, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, the Court of Justice stated that in line with the principle of the precedence of EU law, measures of the EU institutions automatically rendered any conflicting provision of current national law inapplicable. This was crucial to uphold the unconditional and irrevocable obligations of member states under the Treaty and prevent undermining the foundations of the EU.

The ruling in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport emphasized that Parliament voluntarily accepted limits to its sovereignty when the European Communities Act 1972 was enacted, making it obligatory for UK courts to uphold EU laws over national laws. The recent decision in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport highlighted that while the UK constitution is not codified, there are fundamental common law principles that Parliament did not intend to override with the 1972 Act.

Article 65 of the agreement specifically outlawed cartels, while article 66 addressed concentrations, mergers, and the abuse of dominant positions by companies. These provisions marked the incorporation of competition law principles into a plurilateral regional agreement, setting the groundwork for the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957, competition rules were integrated into the Treaty of Rome, which laid the foundation for the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC). The enactment of competition law was identified as a key objective of the EEC, aiming to ensure that competition within the common market remained fair and uninhibited. The treaty included key provisions in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements with some exceptions, and article 86, which prohibited the abuse of dominant positions by companies.

The concept of comparative advantage suggests that countries can mutually benefit from trade even if one has a less efficient economy overall. Similar to other regional bodies like NAFTA or the WTO, the objective of dismantling trade barriers and facilitating the movement of goods, services, labor, and capital is to lower consumer prices. It was initially proposed that a free trade zone would evolve into a customs union, leading to a common market, then a monetary union, followed by a union of monetary and fiscal policies, political integration, and eventually a federal state structure. However, in Europe, these stages were somewhat blended, leaving uncertainty as to whether the final outcome should mirror a traditional nation-state. In actuality, unrestricted free trade, devoid of regulations to ensure fair competition, tends to disproportionately benefit certain individuals and groups (particularly large corporations), while placing heavier burdens on those with less bargaining power in a growing market, such as workers, consumers, small businesses, emerging industries, and local communities. The EU Treaties outline the principle of free movement of goods (articles 28 to 37) and require free movement of people, services, and capital (articles 45 to 66). These \"four freedoms\" were hindered by physical barriers (e.g. customs checks), technical barriers (e.g. varying safety or environmental regulations), and fiscal barriers (e.g. divergent VAT rates). The challenge lies in maintaining a balance between promoting free movement and trade, and preventing their exploitation for unrestricted commercial gains. The Treaties restrict free trade in order to prioritize values such as public health, consumer safety, labor rights, fair competition, and environmental protection.

This means that imports are managed from non-member states, and there are no duties between member states, allowing for the free circulation of imports. According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, any quantitative restrictions on imports or similar measures that could hinder trade between member states are prohibited. This was illustrated in the case of Procureur du Roi v Dassonville, where a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was deemed potentially unlawful as it discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who faced obstacles in obtaining certificates from the French authorities. The concept of a \"wide test\" is used to determine if a law or practice could be an unlawful restriction on trade, and this applies not only to government bodies but also to private actors. For example, in the case of Commission v France, French farmer vigilantes interfering with trade were found to be the responsibility of France due to authorities not taking action to prevent these disturbances. Member states must justify any laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports or exports under TFEU article 36, with justifications including public morality, health protection, environmental reasons, and the protection of national treasures. Moreover, fundamental human rights are prioritized over trade rules, as demonstrated in the case of Schmidberger v Austria where Austria was not found to infringe article 34 by allowing a protest that blocked heavy traffic, emphasizing the importance of freedom of association in a democratic society.

This shift placed greater emphasis on \"citizenship\" to grant individuals with the necessary rights to actively participate in economic and social activities. As outlined in TFEU articles 18 to 21, the fundamental rights of citizens are reflected in the specific rights of workers under TFEU article 45.

The case of Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie exemplifies this, as the Court concluded that Mr. Steymann was entitled to reside in the Netherlands due to his contribution to the Bhagwan community, even without monetary compensation, as long as there was an \"indirect quid pro quo\". Being recognized as a \"worker\" offers protection against discrimination in various aspects such as access to employment, taxation, and social security benefits. On the other hand, a \"citizen\" is defined as an individual holding the nationality of a Member State, with rights to seek employment and participate in local and European elections, albeit with more limited social security entitlements.

Discussions were underway by February 1854 to move the museum to its current site, resulting in a name change to South Kensington Museum.

From the perspective of the object, the motion appears unaffected by gravity. Only when viewed globally can the curvature of space-time be observed, leading to the inference of a gravitational force based on the object's curved path. Essentially, what appears as a straight line trajectory in space-time is observed as a curved path in space, known as the ballistic trajectory.
