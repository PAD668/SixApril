On the other hand, a polynomial time algorithm is not always a practical solution. If its running time is, for example, n^15, it would still be inefficient and only useful for small inputs."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What eponymous variation of arithmetic presents a decision problem not evidenced in P?", "id": "56e1febfe3433e1400423236", "answers": [{"text": "Presburger arithmetic", "answer_start": 333}, {"text": "Presburger", "answer_start": 333}, {"text": "Presburger arithmetic", "answer_start": 333}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an example of a problem to which effective algorithms have provided a solution in spite of the intractability associated with the breadth of sizes?", "id": "56e1febfe3433e1400423238", "answers": [{"text": "NP-complete knapsack problem", "answer_start": 528}, {"text": "NP-complete knapsack", "answer_start": 528}, {"text": "the NP-complete knapsack problem", "answer_start": 524}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How quickly can an algorithm solve an NP-complete knapsack problem?", "id": "56e1febfe3433e1400423239", "answers": [{"text": "in less than quadratic time", "answer_start": 583}, {"text": "less than quadratic time", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "less than quadratic time", "answer_start": 586}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the example of another problem characterized by large instances that is routinely solved by SAT handlers employing efficient algorithms?", "id": "56e1febfe3433e140042323a", "answers": [{"text": "NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem", "answer_start": 673}, {"text": "NP-complete Boolean satisfiability", "answer_start": 673}, {"text": "the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem", "answer_start": 669}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Presburger arithmetic", "answer_start": 333}], "question": "What unknown variation of arithmetic presents a decision problem not evidenced in P?", "id": "5ad56ef05b96ef001a10aea8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "algorithms", "answer_start": 380}], "question": "What has not been done to establish solutions in reasonable period of time?", "id": "5ad56ef05b96ef001a10aea9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "algorithms", "answer_start": 380}], "question": "What can not solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time?", "id": "5ad56ef05b96ef001a10aeaa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In the field of computer science research, the meaning of intractability can vary depending on the context.

This play on words may have involved the Dutch term \"Huisgenoten\" (meaning housemates) and the German word Eidgenosse (referring to the Swiss Confederates). Hugues, a Catholic leader in Geneva, was associated with the \"Confederate Party\" advocating for independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The term \"Huguenot\" was reportedly first used in France for the aristocratic Protestant conspirators involved in the Amboise plot of 1560, a failed attempt to seize power from the House of Guise.

Additionally, steam turbines were widely adopted for propelling large ships throughout the 20th century due to their efficiency and reliability."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the usual source of heat for boiling water in the steam engine?", "id": "571144d1a58dae1900cd6d6e", "answers": [{"text": "burning combustible materials", "answer_start": 168}, {"text": "burning combustible materials", "answer_start": 168}, {"text": "burning combustible materials", "answer_start": 168}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Aside from firebox, what is another name for the space in which combustible material is burned in the engine?", "id": "571144d1a58dae1900cd6d6f", "answers": [{"text": "combustion chamber", "answer_start": 203}, {"text": "combustion chamber", "answer_start": 203}, {"text": "combustion chamber", "answer_start": 203}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Along with nuclear, geothermal and internal combustion engine waste heat, what sort of energy might supply the heat for a steam engine?", "id": "571144d1a58dae1900cd6d70", "answers": [{"text": "solar", "answer_start": 321}, {"text": "solar", "answer_start": 321}, {"text": "solar", "answer_start": 321}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of heating element is often used in toy steam engines?", "id": "571144d1a58dae1900cd6d71", "answers": [{"text": "electric", "answer_start": 467}, {"text": "electric heating element", "answer_start": 467}, {"text": "electric", "answer_start": 467}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "burning combustible materials", "answer_start": 168}], "question": "What is the usual source of heat for boiling water in the industrial process?", "id": "5ad3d689604f3c001a3ff30d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "solar", "answer_start": 321}], "question": "What, aside from firebox, is another name for the space in which combustible material is burned in the electric heating element?", "id": "5ad3d689604f3c001a3ff30e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "electric", "answer_start": 467}], "question": "What type of heating element is often used in toy chamber engines?", "id": "5ad3d689604f3c001a3ff30f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "solar", "answer_start": 321}], "question": "What sort of energy, along with nuclear, geothermal, and internal combustion waste heat, might supply the heat for a firebox?", "id": "5ad3d689604f3c001a3ff310", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "electric", "answer_start": 467}], "question": "What type of heating element is often used in closed space engines?", "id": "5ad3d689604f3c001a3ff311", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "As an engineer working on a new toy steam engine prototype, I am exploring different heat sources for boiling water and supplying steam.

By spreading the steam expansion across multiple cylinders, the heat loss in each cylinder is reduced. This effectively diminishes the heating and cooling of the cylinders, thereby enhancing the engine's efficiency. Through the staged expansion, the variability in torque is also mitigated.

The rotors have blades on the outer edge that are designed like a propeller. When steam hits these blades, it creates circular motion. The stator also has blades that are fixed in place and help direct the steam flow to the next rotor stage. To maximize the potential work extracted from steam at a specific velocity and pressure, the turbine stages are arranged in different sizes for high and low pressure. Steam turbines need to rotate at high speeds to be efficient, so they are often connected to reduction gearing for lower speed applications like a ship's propeller. In large electric generating stations, turbines are usually directly linked to generators without gearing. The standard speeds in the USA are 3600 revolutions per minute for 60 Hertz power systems, and in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz power systems, it's 3000 RPM. In nuclear power plants, the turbines typically run at half these speeds, either 1800 RPM or 1500 RPM.

As a result, the value of the dollar was allowed to fluctuate based on market demand. Following this move, Britain also made the decision to float the pound sterling, prompting other industrialized nations to do the same with their respective currencies. In anticipation of volatile currency values, these nations decided to increase their reserves by injecting more money into circulation than they had previously. This ultimately led to a depreciation of the dollar and other currencies of industrialized nations. The shift had global repercussions, particularly in the oil market, where the fact that oil was priced in dollars led to a decrease in real income for oil producers.

This approach ensures that while the Directives set baseline standards, member states can choose to exceed these standards based on their own regulations. In certain cases, citizens may have grounds to make claims based on national laws implementing Directives, but not directly from the Directives themselves as they lack \"horizontal\" direct effect between non-state parties.

Article 65 of the agreement specifically prohibited cartels, while article 66 addressed concentrations, mergers, and the abuse of dominant positions by companies. These provisions laid the foundation for incorporating competition law principles into plurilateral regional agreements, paving the way for the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957, competition rules were integrated into the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). This treaty made the enactment of competition law a key objective of the EEC, aimed at ensuring that competition in the common market remained fair and free from distortion. Key provisions on competition law for companies were set out in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements with some exceptions, and article 86, which addressed the abuse of dominant positions.

While the theory of comparative advantage suggests mutual benefit in trade, it is essential to strike a balance between promoting free trade and ensuring fair competition. The evolution from a free trade area to a customs union, common market, and beyond has been complex in Europe, raising questions about the ultimate trajectory of EU integration. The principle of free movement of goods, persons, services, and capital, enshrined in EU treaties, aims to eliminate barriers that hinder economic growth and prosperity.

This means that duties between member states are not allowed, and imports can move freely. In line with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, any restrictions on imports or measures that could have a similar effect are prohibited among Member States. In cases such as Procureur du Roi v Dassonville, it was established by the Court of Justice that any trading rules set by Member States that could potentially impede trade, whether directly or indirectly, are not permissible. This ruling specifically impacted parallel importers like Mr. Dassonville, who were disadvantaged by Belgian laws requiring certifications for Scotch whisky imports that they could not obtain from French authorities. The broad interpretation of what constitutes a hindrance to trade also extends to actions by quasi-government entities, as seen in Commission v France where French farmer vigilantes disrupted the import of Spanish strawberries and Belgian tomatoes. This case held France accountable for failing to prevent the sabotage. Member states must justify any laws or practices that discriminate against imports, with justifications including public morality, health and safety, and environmental protection. Additionally, the importance of fundamental human rights has been recognized, with Schmidberger v Austria showing that freedom of association can take precedence over the free movement of goods in certain situations.

Emphasizing citizenship, the goal was to grant people rights that would empower them to be economically and socially active, rather than making economic activity a prerequisite for rights. This approach led to the recognition that the fundamental worker rights outlined in TFEU article 45 are a specific manifestation of the general rights of citizens detailed in TFEU articles 18 to 21. The definition of a \"worker\" by the Court of Justice encompasses anyone engaged in economic activity, including those in unpaid employment relationships. For instance, the case of Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie involved a German individual asserting the right to reside in the Netherlands based on volunteering work in a community. The Court ruled that the individual could remain, as long as there was some form of indirect benefit for the work performed. Being classified as a worker provides protection against discrimination in terms of employment, taxation, and social security entitlements. On the other hand, a citizen, defined as any person holding the nationality of a Member State, has the right to seek employment, participate in local and European elections, but may have more limited access to social security benefits.

In optimal conditions, ctenophores have the ability to consume ten times their own weight in a single day. Currently, only 100-150 species of ctenophores have been officially recognized, with around 25 more potentially awaiting full description and naming.

The phylum showcases a diverse range of body forms, such as the flattened platyctenids found in deep-sea environments, where most adult species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and instead rely on large, stiffened cilia to prey on other ctenophores.

On the other hand, there are also sequential hermaphrodites, where the eggs and sperm mature at different times. Fertilization mostly occurs externally, except for platyctenids, whose eggs are fertilized internally and kept until they hatch. The juvenile stages of most species are planktonic and resemble small cydippids, gradually transforming into their adult forms as they mature. Exceptions include the beroids, whose young have large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose juveniles start as cydippid-like plankton but rapidly change into their adult forms once they reach near-adult size.

This mimicry of jellyfish allows them to efficiently capture their prey. Observing these fascinating creatures in action, it becomes evident that ctenophores exhibit a diverse range of hunting techniques, much like spiders. From motionless hanging to ambushing and even using sticky droplets as bait, their hunting behaviors vary significantly. For instance, the two-tentacled cydippid, Lampea, exclusively preys on salps, and its juveniles exhibit a parasitic relationship with their larger prey. Meanwhile, species like Pleurobrachia and Bolinopsis, commonly found in high population densities in the same areas, specialize in capturing different types of prey to coexist harmoniously - with Pleurobrachia targeting strong swimmers like copepods and Bolinopsis feeding on smaller, less agile creatures such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Why was it thought that  ctenophores were a poor diet for other animals?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33c", "answers": [{"text": "their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 118}, {"text": "their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 118}, {"text": "low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 124}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the oncorhynchus also called?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33d", "answers": [{"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 379}, {"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 379}, {"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 379}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do beroids typically eat?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33e", "answers": [{"text": "ctenophores", "answer_start": 32}, {"text": "other ctenophores", "answer_start": 608}, {"text": "other ctenophores", "answer_start": 608}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where have herbivorous fishes been seen feeding on gelatinous zooplankton?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33f", "answers": [{"text": "the Red Sea", "answer_start": 1114}, {"text": "the Red Sea", "answer_start": 1114}, {"text": "blooms in the Red Sea", "answer_start": 1104}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "good", "answer_start": 540}], "question": "What kind of diet can salmon provide to other predators?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7fe", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ctenophore", "answer_start": 744}], "question": "What kind of populations can be wiped out temporarily by shrimp?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7ff", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In the field of marine biology, ctenophores were previously considered to be \"dead ends\" in marine food chains due to their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water, making them seem like a poor diet for other animals.

Beroids primarily feed on other ctenophores, while some jellyfish and turtles consume large quantities of ctenophores, occasionally causing temporary declines in ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often experience significant fluctuations in population size, most fish that feed on them are generalists and may have a more substantial impact on populations than specialized jelly-eating species.

The situation was exacerbated by overfishing and eutrophication, fueling Mnemiopsis population growth. The absence of natural predators further allowed Mnemiopsis to thrive unchecked.

However, a study conducted by Richard Harbison using purely morphological analysis in 1985 revealed that cydippids are not monophyletic. This means that they do not exclusively include descendants of a single common ancestor that was a cydippid. Instead, Harbison discovered that certain cydippid families showed more resemblance to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He theorized that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores could have had a body shape similar to either a cydippid or a beroid. Subsequent molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, involving 26 species, further supported the conclusion that cydippids are not monophyletic. It indicated that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores likely resembled a cydippid. This analysis also highlighted the small genetic differences between ctenophore species, raising uncertainties about the relationships between Lobata, Cestida, and Thalassocalycida. These findings imply that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores existed relatively recently and may have survived the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event that occurred 65.5 million years ago while other lineages did not. Additionally, when representatives from other phyla were included in the analysis, it suggested that cnidarians may be more closely related to bilaterians than to ctenophores, although this conclusion is not definitive."}]}, {"title": "Fresno,_California", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Which city is the fifth-largest city in California?", "id": "5725ce4d38643c19005acd4d", "answers": [{"text": "Fresno", "answer_start": 11}, {"text": "Fresno", "answer_start": 11}, {"text": "Fresno", "answer_start": 11}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does the name Fresno mean in Spanish?", "id": "5725ce4d38643c19005acd4f", "answers": [{"text": "ash tree", "answer_start": 435}, {"text": "ash tree", "answer_start": 435}, {"text": "ash tree", "answer_start": 435}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is featured on the city of Fresno's city flag?", "id": "5725ce4d38643c19005acd50", "answers": [{"text": "ash leaf", "answer_start": 473}, {"text": "ash leaf", "answer_start": 473}, {"text": "an ash leaf", "answer_start": 470}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "520,159", "answer_start": 136}], "question": "What is the population of Los Angeles?", "id": "5a7b054521c2de001afe9cce", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ash tree", "answer_start": 435}], "question": "What does Sacramento mean in Spanish?", "id": "5a7b054521c2de001afe9ccf", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "San Joaquin Valley", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "What valley is Los Angeles located in?", "id": "5a7b054521c2de001afe9cd1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "California", "answer_start": 78}], "question": "Fresno is the capital of what state?", "id": "5a7b054521c2de001afe9cd2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Welcome to Fresno, also known as FREZ-noh!

Among them was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, who later had the pathogen named after him. The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was discovered by Paul-Louis Simond in 1898, involving fleas whose midguts were blocked by replicating Y. pestis after feeding on an infected host.

Both options are considered valid within the civil disobedience movement. For example, according to ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook, pleading guilty is seen as a statement of pride in one's actions, while pleading not guilty is a declaration of innocence and a refusal to accept wrongdoing. Some individuals opt for a plea of no contest as a middle ground. This creative plea, like one protesting nuclear power, can be seen as a rejection of guilt while maintaining a stance of innocence."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where in Las Vegas did a famous protest take place?", "id": "5728ec6a4b864d19001650aa", "answers": [{"text": "Camp Mercury nuclear test site", "answer_start": 76}, {"text": "Camp Mercury nuclear test site", "answer_start": 76}, {"text": "Camp Mercury nuclear test site", "answer_start": 76}, {"text": "Camp Mercury nuclear test site", "answer_start": 76}, {"text": "Camp Mercury nuclear test site", "answer_start": 76}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How did their lawyer suggest they would plea?", "id": "5728ec6a4b864d19001650ad", "answers": [{"text": "nolo contendere", "answer_start": 600}, {"text": "nolo contendere", "answer_start": 600}, {"text": "nolo contendere", "answer_start": 600}, {"text": "nolo contendere", "answer_start": 600}, {"text": "nolo contendere", "answer_start": 600}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of sentences were the protesters given?", "id": "5728ec6a4b864d19001650ae", "answers": [{"text": "suspended sentences", "answer_start": 665}, {"text": "suspended sentences", "answer_start": 665}, {"text": "suspended", "answer_start": 665}, {"text": "suspended", "answer_start": 665}, {"text": "suspended", "answer_start": 665}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada", "answer_start": 69}], "question": "Where did Francis Heisler plan to have her protest?", "id": "5a668b33f038b7001ab0bf91", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "13", "answer_start": 146}], "question": "How many missles were at the nuclear test site?", "id": "5a668b33f038b7001ab0bf92", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "suspended sentences", "answer_start": 665}], "question": "What sentence was Francis Heisler given when she was found guilty?", "id": "5a668b33f038b7001ab0bf94", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "During the protest organized by the Committee for Non-Violent Action at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas, Nevada in August 1957, 13 activists attempted to enter the test site and were aware that they would be arrested.

The difference in the Gini index before and after taxation provides insight into the impact of progressive tax policies on income distribution."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What does less education lead to when working?", "id": "5727f05b4b864d190016406a", "answers": [{"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 407}, {"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 407}, {"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 407}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of wages do people unable to afford an education receive?", "id": "5729e1101d04691400779643", "answers": [{"text": "lower", "answer_start": 407}, {"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 407}, {"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 407}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What helps to unleash the productivity ability of the poor?", "id": "5729e1101d04691400779645", "answers": [{"text": "education", "answer_start": 57}, {"text": "education", "answer_start": 57}, {"text": "education", "answer_start": 57}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 407}], "question": "What does more education lead to when working?", "id": "5ad24840d7d075001a428b5e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "savings and investment", "answer_start": 541}], "question": "What are those with lower incomes more likely to have in order to prepare for the future?", "id": "5ad24840d7d075001a428b60", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Inequality is greatly influenced by the accessibility of education.

Some experts, like Paul Krugman, believe that trade liberalisation has played a role in the growing income gap in countries like the United States. They point to the fact that jobs that require lower skills have become more easily tradable, leading to this effect. However, it is important to note that the impact of trade on income inequality is considered minor when compared to factors like technological advancements. Studies have shown that international trade does contribute to income inequality, as predicted by economic theories. For example, Lawrence Katz estimates that trade accounts for only a small percentage of the rise in income inequality.

In contrast, a richer individual spending an extra dollar likely goes towards luxury items that offer relatively less utility.

It is crucial to recognize that the rise in environmental degradation is influenced by the multiplier effect of increasing emissions per person.

He then organized a kurultai in Kaiping that ultimately elected him as the new Great Khan. However, a rival kurultai in Mongolia declared Ariq B\u00f6ke as the Great Khan, sparking a civil war. Kublai relied on the support of his Chinese subjects to ensure his army had the necessary resources. He also gained popularity by adopting the Chinese era name of Zhongtong and modeling his government after traditional Chinese dynasties. Ariq B\u00f6ke struggled due to a lack of supplies and eventually surrendered in 1264. The western khanates (Golden Horde, Chagatai Khanate, and Ilkhanate) all became functionally autonomous, with only the Ilkhans fully recognizing Kublai as Great Khan.

This groundbreaking approach is further illustrated with a diagram of Pascal's triangle and also includes the concept of summing finite arithmetic series."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did Gou use for astronomy?", "id": "5728809f2ca10214002da40d", "answers": [{"text": "a cubic interpolation formula", "answer_start": 175}, {"text": "cubic interpolation formula", "answer_start": 177}, {"text": "derived a cubic interpolation formula", "answer_start": 167}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the English name of Gou's calendar?", "id": "5728809f2ca10214002da40f", "answers": [{"text": "Calendar for Fixing the Seasons", "answer_start": 30}, {"text": "Calendar for Fixing the Seasons", "answer_start": 30}, {"text": "Calendar for Fixing the Seasons", "answer_start": 30}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Gou's calendar become the official calendar of the Yuan?", "id": "5728809f2ca10214002da410", "answers": [{"text": "1281", "answer_start": 92}, {"text": "1281", "answer_start": 92}, {"text": "1281", "answer_start": 92}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "cubic interpolation formula", "answer_start": 177}], "question": " What did Gou use for science?", "id": "5ad40a72604f3c001a3fffaa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Shoushi Li", "answer_start": 0}], "question": " What was the Chinese name of Gou's math?", "id": "5ad40a72604f3c001a3fffab", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Calendar for Fixing the Seasons", "answer_start": 30}], "question": " What was the English name of Gou's math?", "id": "5ad40a72604f3c001a3fffac", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1281", "answer_start": 92}], "question": " When was Gou's calendar rejected as the official calendar of the Yuan?", "id": "5ad40a72604f3c001a3fffad", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Shoushi Li, also known as the Calendar for Fixing the Seasons, was created by Shoushi Li in 1281 during the Yuan dynasty.

In the diagram on the right, it is shown that 12 is not a prime number as it can be written as the product of 3 and 4. It is a rule in mathematics that no even number greater than 2 can be a prime number. This is because any such number, denoted as 'n', will have at least three distinct divisors: 1, 2, and n. This rule proves that 'n' cannot be a prime number. This is the reason why we refer to prime numbers greater than 2 as odd primes. It is also interesting to note that all prime numbers larger than 5, when written in the decimal system, will end in either 1, 3, 7, or 9.

Opposition leaders start with a general question for the First Minister, followed by supplementary questions on any issue they choose. This format provides a structured approach to questioning and facilitates in-depth discussion on important issues."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the number of Constituency MSPs?", "id": "572fd8efb2c2fd14005684f9", "answers": [{"text": "73", "answer_start": 75}, {"text": "73", "answer_start": 75}, {"text": "73", "answer_start": 75}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many members can voters choose to represent the constituency?

One of the key distinctions of empires lies in the extent of land they have conquered and governed. While political power was often acquired through land expansion, the cultural and economic aspects thrived through sea and trade routes. It is important to note that while political empires primarily grew through land expansion, economic and cultural influences spread equally through seaborne routes. Trade involving animals and plant products played a significant role in this overseas exchange. The European empires in Asia and Africa are typically viewed as the quintessential examples of imperialism, with a focus on the European seaborne empires in most historical accounts. This European expansion led to a division in the world, as seen through the lens of world systems theory, into core and periphery regions. The core regions are characterized by high income and profit levels, while the periphery regions struggle with low income and profit margins. These geopolitical theories have sparked debates on the impact of imperialism in the post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin proposed that imperialism represented the highest stage of capitalism, differentiating it from colonialism through the emergence of monopoly capitalism. Lenin's ideas highlight the evolving nature of the global political landscape and the importance of understanding the new world order. Today, geopolitics centers on states vying for economic dominance, with some states being labeled as empires due to their significant political and economic influence over other nations."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Imperialism is confused with what other term?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6d", "answers": [{"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 100}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 100}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 100}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 100}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 100}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does colonialism lack that imperialism has?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6e", "answers": [{"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 951}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 951}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 951}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 951}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 229}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Colonialism as a policy is caused by financial and what other reasons?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6f", "answers": [{"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 229}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 229}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 229}, {"text": "commercial", "answer_start": 384}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who besides the Russians are often left out of the colonialism debat?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce70", "answers": [{"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1041}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1041}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1041}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1041}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1041}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Imperialism and colonialism both assert a states dominance over what?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce71", "answers": [{"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 510}, {"text": "a person or group of people", "answer_start": 508}, {"text": "a person or group of people", "answer_start": 508}, {"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 510}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 100}], "question": "Imperialism is synonymous with what other term?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a686628", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 951}], "question": " What does colonialism and imperialism share?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a686629", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 229}], "question": "Colonialism as a policy is never caused by financial and what other reasons?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1041}], "question": "Who besides the Russians are often included in the colonialism debat?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 510}], "question": "Imperialism and colonialism don't assert a states dominance over what?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In the realm of academic discourse, there exists a distinction between the terms \"imperialism\" and \"colonialism\", despite their frequent conflation.

Additionally, Edward Said further clarifies the distinction by emphasizing that imperialism involves the exercise of control and governance from a distant center, whereas colonialism typically involves the physical occupation of a foreign territory.

While some viewed imperialism as a form of idealism and philanthropy, others saw it as driven by political self-interest and capitalist greed. Influential thinkers such as John A. Hobson and Vladimir Lenin added macroeconomic perspectives to the discussion, with Lenin emphasizing the need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources, and manpower through colonial expansion. This structural view of imperialism as a natural consequence of capitalism has had a lasting impact on Marxist theories.

For instance, the treatment of indigenous populations during America's westward expansion exemplifies the nation's early imperialistic tendencies prior to its external ventures. Referred to as \"internal colonialism\", this method of control was also evident in America's involvement in the African slave trade, impacting an estimated 12 to 15 million individuals. While resistance to internal colonialism did exist, it lacked the same level of visibility as movements against external colonial powers due to the overwhelming dominance wielded by the United States over both indigenous and African-American communities.

Additionally, I always suggest exploring Pole Mokotowskie, a large park in the northern Mokot\u00f3w area with a rich history as the site of the first horse racetrack and later an airport. Park Ujazdowski, located near the Sejm and John Lennon street, is another beautiful green space worth visiting. Other parks within the city include the Park of Culture and Rest in Powsin, Park Skaryszewski on the right bank of the Vistula in Praga, and the historic Praga Park designed by Jan Dobrowolski. It's interesting to note that in 1927, a zoological garden was established within the grounds of Praga Park, featuring a bear run that remains open to visitors today."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the Bielany Forest the last remnant of?", "id": "573368e54776f41900660a55", "answers": [{"text": "Masovian Primeval Forest", "answer_start": 164}, {"text": "Masovian Primeval Forest", "answer_start": 164}, {"text": "Masovian Primeval Forest", "answer_start": 164}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What forest is by Warsaw's southern border?", "id": "573368e54776f41900660a56", "answers": [{"text": "Kabaty", "answer_start": 193}, {"text": "Kabaty Forest", "answer_start": 193}, {"text": "Kabaty", "answer_start": 193}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many botanical gardens does Warsaw have?", "id": "573368e54776f41900660a57", "answers": [{"text": "two", "answer_start": 623}, {"text": "two", "answer_start": 623}, {"text": "two", "answer_start": 623}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "two", "answer_start": 623}], "question": "How many botanical gardens does Kampinos have?", "id": "5ad50fe55b96ef001a10ab4c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Masovian Primeval Forest", "answer_start": 164}], "question": "What is the Kampinos Forest the last remnant of?", "id": "5ad50fe55b96ef001a10ab4f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Kabaty", "answer_start": 193}], "question": "What forest is by Kampinos's southern border?", "id": "5ad50fe55b96ef001a10ab50", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Persona: Tourist exploring the natural attractions of Warsaw\n\nRephrased Context:\n\nWarsaw is blessed with a diverse flora, thanks to its strategic location near the Masovian Primeval Forest and Kabaty Forest.

Essentially, Newton's First Law negates the common belief that a net force is necessary to maintain constant velocity in objects.

The conservation of momentum stems from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and is thus considered more fundamental than the idea of force. That's why the currently known fundamental forces are more accurately referred to as \"fundamental interactions.\" When particle A emits or absorbs virtual particle B, momentum conservation causes particle A to recoil, creating the impression of either repulsion or attraction between particles A and A' exchanging by B. This principle applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While complex mathematical descriptions are necessary for precise predictions of these interactions, we can conceptualize them using Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented by a straight line moving through time, which usually increases upwards or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are essentially the same, except for their direction of propagation through the diagram. These particles intersect at interaction vertices, with any force resulting from an interaction occurring at these points, leading to an instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines.

Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantly in action-reaction pairs, meaning that if one object exerts a force along the string, the other object will exert an equal force in the opposite direction. By attaching the same string multiple times to one object using movable pulleys, we can multiply the tension force on a load.
