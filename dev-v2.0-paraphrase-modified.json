If the exhaust event is too brief, it can lead to steam not being able to properly evacuate the cylinder, causing excessive compression known as \"kick back.\""}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who received the first steam engine patent?", "id": "57115f652419e314009555b9", "answers": [{"text": "Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont", "answer_start": 172}, {"text": "Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont", "answer_start": 172}, {"text": "Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont", "answer_start": 172}, {"text": "Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont", "answer_start": 172}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the nationality of Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont?", "id": "57115f652419e314009555ba", "answers": [{"text": "Spanish", "answer_start": 155}, {"text": "Spanish", "answer_start": 155}, {"text": "Spanish", "answer_start": 155}, {"text": "Spanish", "answer_start": 155}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont receive a steam engine patent?", "id": "57115f652419e314009555bb", "answers": [{"text": "1606", "answer_start": 204}, {"text": "1606", "answer_start": 204}, {"text": "1606", "answer_start": 204}, {"text": "1606", "answer_start": 204}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Savery patent his steam pump?", "id": "57115f652419e314009555bc", "answers": [{"text": "1698", "answer_start": 213}, {"text": "1698", "answer_start": 213}, {"text": "1698", "answer_start": 213}, {"text": "1698", "answer_start": 213}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Newcomen's engine pump in a mine?", "id": "57115f652419e314009555bd", "answers": [{"text": "1712", "answer_start": 561}, {"text": "1712", "answer_start": 561}, {"text": "1712", "answer_start": 561}, {"text": "1712", "answer_start": 561}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Jer\u00f3nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont", "answer_start": 172}], "question": "Who received the first chamber engine patent?", "id": "5ad3be46604f3c001a3fef37", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Spanish", "answer_start": 155}], "question": "What was the nationality of Thomas Newcomen?", "id": "5ad3be46604f3c001a3fef38", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1606", "answer_start": 204}], "question": "In what year did Thomas Newcomen receive a steam engine patent?", "id": "5ad3be46604f3c001a3fef39", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1698", "answer_start": 213}], "question": "In what year did Newcomen patent his steam pump?", "id": "5ad3be46604f3c001a3fef3a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1712", "answer_start": 561}], "question": "In what year did Savery's engine pump in a mine?", "id": "5ad3be46604f3c001a3fef3b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Boiling water has been used for mechanical motion since ancient times, but early devices were not practical.

Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet also announced his method. The liquid produced in both cases was so small that no proper analysis could be done. Polish scientists Zygmunt Wr\u00f3blewski and Karol Olszewski were able to successfully liquefy oxygen on March 29, 1883 at the Jagiellonian University."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What celestial object eluded efforts to measure oxygen?", "id": "571cac5d5efbb31900334dd0", "answers": [{"text": "Sun", "answer_start": 220}, {"text": "the Sun", "answer_start": 216}, {"text": "the Sun", "answer_start": 216}, {"text": "Sun", "answer_start": 220}, {"text": "the Sun", "answer_start": 216}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What molecule does the Sun have in higher proportion than Earth?", "id": "571cac5d5efbb31900334dd1", "answers": [{"text": "oxygen-16", "answer_start": 468}, {"text": "oxygen-16", "answer_start": 468}, {"text": "oxygen-16", "answer_start": 468}, {"text": "oxygen-16", "answer_start": 468}, {"text": "oxygen-16", "answer_start": 468}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What spacecraft contained data to determine the oxygen content of the Sun?", "id": "571cac5d5efbb31900334dd2", "answers": [{"text": "Genesis spacecraft", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "Genesis", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "Genesis", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "Genesis", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "Genesis", "answer_start": 398}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Before the formation of which planet, did Sol lose oxygen 16?", "id": "571cac5d5efbb31900334dd4", "answers": [{"text": "Earth", "answer_start": 55}, {"text": "Earth", "answer_start": 55}, {"text": "Earth", "answer_start": 55}, {"text": "the Earth", "answer_start": 483}, {"text": "Earth", "answer_start": 55}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites", "answer_start": 55}], "question": "Where have Genesis geologists measured oxygen isotopes?", "id": "5ad25553d7d075001a428d34", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "in the Sun", "answer_start": 213}], "question": "Where were Genesis geologists unable to measure oxygen?", "id": "5ad25553d7d075001a428d35", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space", "answer_start": 317}], "question": "What did the Planetary spacecraft analyze?", "id": "5ad25553d7d075001a428d36", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Sun", "answer_start": 216}], "question": "What does the Earth have a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than?", "id": "5ad25553d7d075001a428d37", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Recent measurements of oxygen isotopes in samples from Earth, the Moon, Mars, and meteorites have revealed variations in their abundance.

This was highlighted in the case of R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, where it was stated that Parliament voluntarily accepted limitations on its sovereignty when it passed the European Communities Act 1972. The German Constitutional Court's view is that if the EU does not adhere to its constitutional rights and principles, particularly democracy and the rule of law, it cannot overrule German law. However, as long as the EU aims to democratize its institutions and protect human rights, the German court would not assess EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles.

Additionally, individuals or companies can use a Directive in disputes not only with public authorities but also with other private entities, as seen in the case of CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel.

Initially focusing on the free movement of workers as a factor of production, the European Community shifted its focus towards building a more social Europe in the 1970s. Free movement began to be centered around citizenship, granting individuals rights to be economically and socially active, rather than requiring economic activity as a prerequisite for rights. This led to the interpretation of \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 as a specific representation of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a worker encompasses anyone engaged in economic activity, including those in an employment relationship for remuneration. In cases like Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, individuals have been granted the right to stay based on an indirect exchange for their work, even if it is unpaid. Worker status ensures protection against discrimination in various aspects such as employment, tax, and social security rights. On the other hand, a citizen, defined as any person with the nationality of a Member State, has rights to seek employment, vote in elections, but limited access to social security benefits. Despite concerns raised by nationalist parties regarding immigrants impacting local job opportunities and benefits, research has shown minimal effects of labor mobility on wages and employment of local workers."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which Belgian footballer claimed that he should be allowed to transfer from one football club to another when his contract was fulfilled?", "id": "5726bc1add62a815002e8ea7", "answers": [{"text": "Jean-Marc Bosman", "answer_start": 303}, {"text": "the Belgian Football Association v Bosman", "answer_start": 235}, {"text": "Jean-Marc Bosman", "answer_start": 303}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What language did the Court of Justice accept to be required to teach in a Dublin college in Groner v Minister for Education?", "id": "5726bc1add62a815002e8ea8", "answers": [{"text": "Gaelic", "answer_start": 576}, {"text": "Gaelic", "answer_start": 576}, {"text": "Gaelic", "answer_start": 576}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which case was a Dutch national not entitled to continue receiving benefits when he moved to Belgium?", "id": "5726bc1add62a815002e8ea9", "answers": [{"text": "Hendrix v Employee", "answer_start": 1280}, {"text": "Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute", "answer_start": 1280}, {"text": "Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute", "answer_start": 1280}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Jean-Marc Bosman", "answer_start": 303}], "question": "Which Belgian footballer claimed that he should not be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Liege to USL Dunkerque?", "id": "5ad157cf645df0001a2d1816", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "equal treatment", "answer_start": 63}], "question": "What did most people not require regarding social advantages?", "id": "5ad157cf645df0001a2d1817", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Free Movement of Workers Regulation outlines the rules for equal treatment of workers, including the ability to work, make contracts, and not face discrimination compared to citizens of the member state.

The Court of Justice ruled that transfer rules could impede free movement and needed a valid public interest justification. In Groener v Minister for Education, a language requirement for teaching Gaelic was accepted if it promoted Irish language without being excessive. In Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA, a bank was not allowed to demand a bilingual certificate for non-local residents. The Court reasoned that it was unfair as it was hard for foreigners to obtain the certificate. Tax benefits must also be provided equally to cross-border workers, as seen in Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker. However, in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg, a re-registration charge for bringing a car to Austria was deemed lawful as it applied uniformly to Austrians as well. Social advantages should also be treated equally, although residency requirements may apply. In the case of Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute, a Dutch national was denied benefits when moving to Belgium due to the benefit's tie to the Netherlands' socio-economic conditions. Similarly, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, a Dutch woman working part-time in Germany was not entitled to German child benefits, unlike a full-time worker from Austria residing in Germany.

In \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH, the Court of Justice established that a German court could not prevent a Dutch company from enforcing a contract in Germany based on invalid incorporation in Germany.

The extent of this reduction is debated among scientists. Some believe the rainforest was largely diminished, existing in isolated refugia surrounded by open forest and grassland, while others argue that the rainforest remained mostly intact but with a smaller geographic range.

Research on chum salmon revealed that they can digest ctenophores 20 times faster than an equal amount of shrimps, showing that ctenophores can be a good source of food if they are abundant. Beroids primarily prey on other ctenophores, while some jellyfish and turtles consume large quantities of ctenophores, which can lead to temporary population declines.

As faults and other deformational events reshape the landscape, material from elevated rock units is worn away by erosion, while sediments are deposited on lower-lying formations.

Volcanism and igneous activity often coincide with deformational events, with volcanic ashes and lavas accumulating on the surface and igneous intrusions penetrating from below.

In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis conducted experiments with scorpion venom, noting that certain animals showed immunity. Louis Pasteur later built upon these observations to develop vaccination and propose the germ theory of disease, which challenged prevailing ideas like the miasma theory.

Computational methods have been developed to anticipate the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, aiding in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing potential harm from mutations in viral coat particles, and validating peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques noted that hydrophilic amino acids are more common in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids, while recent advances use machine learning on databases of known epitopes, often from well-studied virus proteins. A publicly available database has been established to document epitopes recognized by B cells on pathogens.

One significant aspect of an empire is the extent of land it has conquered and expanded. While political power was historically obtained through territorial conquest, cultural and economic influences often spread via sea and trade routes. A key observation about empires is that while political empires typically expanded over land, economic and cultural influences were disseminated largely through maritime routes. European empires in Asia and Africa are commonly recognized as the archetypal forms of imperialism, with a focus on European seaborne empires in historical accounts. The development of the world systems theory has highlighted the division between core and peripheral regions, with the former characterized by high income and profit levels, and the latter by low income and profit margins. This critical perspective on geo-politics has sparked discussions on the impact of imperialism in the post-colonial world. Lenin posited that imperialism, as distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism, represented the pinnacle of capitalist development. This insight underscores the significance of a new global political order in present times, where states are increasingly viewed as empires due to their political and economic dominance over other nations."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Imperialism is confused with what other term?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6d", "answers": [{"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 40}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 40}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 40}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 40}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 40}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does colonialism lack that imperialism has?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6e", "answers": [{"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 692}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 692}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 692}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 692}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 214}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Colonialism as a policy is caused by financial and what other reasons?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6f", "answers": [{"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 214}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 214}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 214}, {"text": "commercial", "answer_start": 300}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who besides the Russians are often left out of the colonialism debat?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce70", "answers": [{"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 576}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 576}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 576}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 576}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 576}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Imperialism and colonialism both assert a states dominance over what?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce71", "answers": [{"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 135}, {"text": "a person or group of people", "answer_start": 133}, {"text": "a person or group of people", "answer_start": 133}, {"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 135}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 40}], "question": "Imperialism is synonymous with what other term?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a686628", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 692}], "question": " What does colonialism and imperialism share?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a686629", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 214}], "question": "Colonialism as a policy is never caused by financial and what other reasons?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 576}], "question": "Who besides the Russians are often included in the colonialism debat?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 135}], "question": "Imperialism and colonialism don't assert a states dominance over what?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The distinction between imperialism and colonialism is often debated by scholars.
