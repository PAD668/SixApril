Initially, the European Community focused on the movement of workers as an economic factor. However, the focus shifted towards creating a more social Europe from the 1970s onwards. Free movement was increasingly linked to citizenship, granting individuals rights to actively participate economically and socially, rather than economic activity being a prerequisite for rights. This means that the specific worker rights in TFEU article 45 are a manifestation of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a worker is defined as anyone who is economically active, even if they are not paid monetarily for their work. This was exemplified in the case of Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, where a German man was allowed to stay in the Netherlands due to his volunteer work in exchange for benefits provided by the community. Being classified as a worker provides protection against discrimination in various aspects such as employment, taxation, and social security. On the other hand, a citizen, defined as someone holding the nationality of a Member State, has rights related to employment and voting but limited access to social security benefits.

In the well-known case of the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, Jean-Marc Bosman argued that he should be able to transfer to a different football club when his contract ended, regardless of transfer fees. The Court of Justice agreed that transfer rules could impede free movement and needed to be justified in the public interest.\n\nIn instances like the Groener v Minister for Education case, where a requirement to speak Gaelic was justified to promote the Irish language, it had to be proportionate.

The evolutionary position of ctenophores has been a topic of debate, with current molecular studies suggesting a closer relationship between cnidarians and bilaterians. Recent analysis suggests that the common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like and that their diverse groups likely emerged after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. It has been shown since the 1980s that the \"cydippids\" are not monophyletic, meaning they do not entirely descend from a single common ancestor, as other ctenophore groups also originate from different cydippids.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 522, "text": "66 million years ago"}, {"answer_start": 147, "text": "515 million years ago"}, {"answer_start": 522, "text": "66 million years ago"}], "question": "When did the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction happen?", "id": "5725c91e38643c19005acceb"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 147, "text": "515 million years"}, {"answer_start": 522, "text": "66 million years ago"}, {"answer_start": 147, "text": "515 million years"}], "question": "How old are the fossils found that represent ctenophhores ?", "id": "5725c91e38643c19005acced"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 16, "text": "tentacles"}, {"answer_start": 16, "text": "tentacles"}, {"answer_start": 16, "text": "tentacles"}], "question": "What were the fossils that were found to represent ctenphores missing that current ctenphora have?", "id": "5725c91e38643c19005accee"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 147, "text": "515 million years"}, {"answer_start": 522, "text": "66 million years"}, {"answer_start": 147, "text": "515 million years"}], "question": "Fossils found that were believed to be ctenophores were how old?", "id": "5726449f1125e71900ae1928"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 484, "text": "Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction"}, {"answer_start": 480, "text": "the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction"}, {"answer_start": 484, "text": "Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction"}], "question": "What event happened 66 million years ago?", "id": "5726449f1125e71900ae1929"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 607, "text": "monophyletic"}, {"answer_start": 607, "text": "monophyletic"}, {"answer_start": 607, "text": "monophyletic"}], "question": "Cypiddids are not what?", "id": "5726449f1125e71900ae192a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 16, "text": "tentacles"}, {"answer_start": 16, "text": "tentacles"}, {"answer_start": 16, "text": "tentacles"}], "question": "What do current ctenophores have that fossils found did not have?", "id": "5726449f1125e71900ae192b"}]}, {"context": "Ctenophores are a phylum of animals that are more complex than sponges, similar in complexity to cnidarians and less complex than bilaterians.

Haeckelia, a genus within the ctenophores, hunts jellyfish and integrates the stinging cells of their prey into their own tentacles rather than using colloblasts. Ctenophores exhibit diverse feeding techniques, similar to spiders, ranging from hanging motionless in the water to using their tentacles as \"webs\" to ambushing prey like jumping spiders. The cydippid ctenophore Lampea exclusively preys on salps and attaches to larger salps like a parasite to feed. Pleurobrachia and Bolinopsis, members of the cydippid genus, often have high population densities in the same area because they specialize in different prey types: Pleurobrachia captures strong swimmers like adult copepods with its long tentacles, while Bolinopsis targets smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Almost all ctenophores are predators"}, {"answer_start": 27, "text": "predators"}, {"answer_start": 27, "text": "predators"}], "question": "Are ctenophores predators, vegetarian or parasitic?", "id": "5726887e708984140094c917"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 459, "text": "jellyfish"}, {"answer_start": 459, "text": "jellyfish"}, {"answer_start": 459, "text": "jellyfish"}], "question": "Haeckelia prey mostly on what animal?", "id": "5726887e708984140094c918"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 785, "text": "Lampea"}, {"answer_start": 785, "text": "Lampea"}, {"answer_start": 785, "text": "Lampea"}], "question": "What is the name of the two-tentacled cydippid that feedsentirely on salps called?", "id": "5726887e708984140094c91b"}]}, {"context": "Previously seen as dead ends in marine food chains due to their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water, ctenophores were considered an inadequate diet for other animals.

Computational methods are now used to forecast the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, aiding in therapeutic antibody design, assessing mutation impacts on viral particles, and confirming peptide-based drug treatments. Initially, hydrophilic amino acids were noted to be more common in epitopes than hydrophobic ones; recent advancements use machine learning with epitope databases as a training set. A database is available to record pathogen epitopes identifiable by B cells, and the emerging area of bioinformatics focused on immunogenicity is known as immunoinformatics.

A crucial distinction is that economic and cultural impacts were spread more significantly by sea despite political empires being built mainly through overland expansion. Trade across oceans mainly involved the exchange of animals and plant products. Historically, European empires in Asia and Africa are considered the quintessential examples of imperialism, with a focus on European seaborne empires in most literature on the subject. This colonial expansion led to the division of the world into core and periphery regions, with the core characterized by high income and profit, and the periphery by low income and profit. These geopolitical theories have sparked discussions on the effects of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. Lenin, a Russian leader, posited that imperialism, as distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism, represented the pinnacle of capitalism.
